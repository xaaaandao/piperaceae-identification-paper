## How to run

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
$ python main.py [ARGS]
```

List of args available:

- `-C, --config` [**NO REQUIRED**]: path to the configuration file.
  - - In the next version.

- `-c, --clf` [**NO REQUIRED**]: classifier to run experiments.
  - The classifiers available are: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, MLPClassifier, SVC.
  - DEFAULT: `DecisionTreeClassifier`;

- `-i, --input` [**REQUIRED**]: path to features.
  - DEFAULT is `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
  - The `--input` must contain files in formats {`.npy`, `.npz`, `.csv` or `.txt`} and the other two files (`dataset.csv` and `samples.csv`).
    - `dataset.csv` and `samples.csv` are generated by this [code](). More details are available in this [repository]().

- `-o, --output` [**NO REQUIRED**]: path to save.
  - DEFAULT: create a folder named output;

- `-p, --pca` [**NO REQUIRED**]: enable or no PCA
  - In the next version.

## Output

This code creates folders based on the number of folds and two folders (`mean` and `best`):

- `mean`: contains CSV files with mean and standard deviation using F1-Score, Accuracy, Top-k, and count of True Positive;
  - The True Positive is calculated using the Confusion Matrix.
- `best`: had CSV files with the highest rates achieved in this execution;
- `fold+1`...`fold+n`: the number folder called fold depends on the number fold set to run. In this folder was available information about:
  - `confusion_matrix`
    - `normalized`: is a Confusion Matrix with all classes and values between 0 and 1;
    - `multilabel`: is a Confusion Matrix for each class.
  - `best_evals.csv`: the rule that achieved the highest rate on F1-Score and accuracy;
  - `evals.csv`:  the F1-Score and accuracy for each rule;
  - `infos.csv`: time to train and count of samples used in train and test;
  - `preds.csv`: list of predictions generated by the model;
  - `topk.csv`: count of hits to k = 3 to k = n-1, where n is a count of classes;
  - `true_positive.csv`: count of true positives for each class.
